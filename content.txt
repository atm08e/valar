In King's Landing

After the victory over Lord Stannis Baratheon in the Battle of Blackwater, King Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) gives Lord Tywin Lannister (Charles Dance), his grandfather, the title of Savior of King's Landing for his help in the Battle of Blackwater Bay and formally names him Hand of the King. For uniting the Houses of Tyrell and Lannister, the alliance which caused the victory, Lord Petyr Baelish (Aidan Gillen) is given the Castle of Harrenhal. Lady Margaery Tyrell (Natalie Dormer) asks for the King's hand in marriage, and though Joffrey insists he is bound by oath to Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner), Queen Regent Cersei (Lena Headey) and her subject Grand Maester Pycelle (Julian Glover) argue that the Gods will allow him to reject the oath on grounds of Eddard Stark's treason. Sansa appears elated to be rid of Joffrey, but Baelish warns her that she is still in danger while she is in King's Landing. He offers to scheme to see her home safely. Lord Varys (Conleth Hill) works to undermine Baelish's successes and plots to turn his associate, the prostitute Ros (Esme Bianco), against him.

Meanwhile, a scarred Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) wakes from the injuries that he received from the attempt on his life during the battle. With the arrival of Lord Tywin, he has been removed from the position of Hand of the King and is left powerless and without allies, except for his squire, Podrick Payne (Daniel Portman). He is consoled by his concubine, Shae (Sibel Kekilli), who remains loyal and tries to convince Tyrion to leave King's Landing for Pentos with her. Lord Varys informs Tyrion that the Queen was behind the attempt on his life and says that he knows Tyrion to have been the true hero of the battle, even though he will receive no official credit. Despite his fall from power, Tyrion refuses to leave King's Landing, saying that he has finally found a role he both excels at and enjoys.
