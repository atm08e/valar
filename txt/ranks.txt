I really dont like the idea of having a full fledge rank system . I am thinking of a system as the US military has it. Instead i perfer a system that has equality amongst all. But at the same time reward members that have stayed true. That is why the outfit will be broken into very few ranks.
<br><br>
A rank outline I have in mind is..<br><br>
1) Commanders - These guys organize with other NC outfits and cordinate battle plans with captains.<br>
2) Legacy - This member has fought with us since the beta.<br>
3) Senior - This members has proven themselves time after time. You dont need to worry about them watching your back!<br>
4) Captain - This member has shown their skill for leading and cordinating others.We gladly accept their group invites and follow their orders!<br>
5) Members - These are the true heroes of the outfit. We are the 99%. We are the iron fist that breaks down the doors!<br>
6) Recruits - These members just joined the outfit. They need to prove themselves to become a member! More on this one later.<br>
