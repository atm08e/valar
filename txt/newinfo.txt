Goals of the outfit:<br><br>
1) An organized group of individuals that will strategically seek the destruction and conquering of  all Vanu and Terrain Republic forces.<br><br>
2) No discrimination against sex, race, or age. We will accept all willing, but if we find your being a lackey and/or just plain trollish we will not hesitate to kick you. To be brief, we expect a soldier ready to  battle and no more. If you are the type of solider that dies a lot don't worry. This outfit could be the perfect place for you! Some people just have to be meat shields for others.<br><br>
3) We wish to have coordination with other NC outfits on the server. To accomplish goal number one it is crucial that a good relationship with all NC outfits be maintained. Coordination amongst outfits will be paramount in the coming months. It is also our outfit's wishes that our server attract the best NC players available.   <br><br>
